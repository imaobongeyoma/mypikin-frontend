# Project Title

myPIKIN

## Overview

myPIKIN is a place where parents can find home daycares close to them. My Pikin means My Child in Nigerian pidgin English.

### Problem

There is a huge day care crisis in many areas in Canada. There are issues on two fronts:
Parents are facing significant challenges in getting reliable and affordable childcare for their children. The wait lists are long and the wait times are unreasonable with some parents having to wait more than a year to get care for their children. This causes a lot of frustration and stress for families as sometimes, these parents are unable to go back to work as they have to embark on fulltime childcare responsibilities till a daycare spot opens up for them.

On the second front, daycare workers often find themselves undercompensated for the crucial role that they play in early childhood development. Despite the demanding nature of their work and thhe great impact they have on children's lives, many daycare workers struggle to make ends meet due to low wages and limited benefits. This not only affects the livelihoods of daycare workers but also undermines the quality of care provided to children. In recent months, may day care centers have had to shutdown because they could no longer afford the expenses of running the centers.

I believe there is an untapped solution for these issues - Home Daycares. So many people (stay at home parents, early childhood educators, friends and family) have a passion for taking care of children but they currently either do it for just their kids/family without compensation or do it for too little compensation. If they could turn this passion into a business, they would not only make some income from it but also help reduce the waitlist/wait times for finding daycare. This is where myPIKIN comes in. The goal of myPIKIN is to help parents find home daycares in their area! Also childcare providers would be able to set their prices for their service.
